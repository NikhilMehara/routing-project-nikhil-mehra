        We are maximisers. We're out on our own journeys to maximise - be the best at what we choose and care about the most - 
        whether it be our impact, voice, potential, ideas, influence, well-being or more. 
        Because when we maximise ourselves in our inclusive teams, Flipkart is able to deliver the best imaginable value for our customers,
         stakeholders and the planet!

                      We're known more by the impact we create
                     than the titles we hold. Impact that is brought by
                     working together on audacious challenges at scale
                     with an aim to revolutionize for the Indian customer.
                     We believe great ideas can emerge from anywhere
                     and must be backed. Our people - backed by our
                     culture of end-to-end ownership - have revolutionised
                     India's e-commerce sector - several times over!
